# sortAlgorithms.js

This repository is part of a [series of posts](https://initjs.org/tagged/sorting-algorithms) on [my blog](https://initjs.org) on sorting algorithms reimplemented in JavaScript.

## About the #sorting-algorithmsÂ series

The #sorting-algorithms series is a collection of posts on how to implement various sorts in JavaScript.
If you're a beginner to algorithms, I suggest you read [introduction to algorithms](https://initjs.org) first.

Each article will cover a great deal with high level information, analysis, time complexity, pseudocode and real code. If you're strictly looking for the code, you csan find them in this repository :bowtie:

## Sorting Algorithms covered:
- [x] Bubble Sort
